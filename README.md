# Wind Resource Temporal Variability

This repo uses statistical analyses and visualizations to explore the diurnal and monthly variability of wind resources using data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) [Wind Integration National Dataset (WIND) Toolkit](https://www.nrel.gov/grid/wind-toolkit.html). This main analysis is for one site but can be expanded to a larger scale using report parameters.
